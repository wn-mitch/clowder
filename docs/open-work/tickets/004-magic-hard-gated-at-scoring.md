## Current state

**`src/ai/scoring.rs:483`** — `PracticeMagic` only scored if
`ctx.magic_affinity > 0.3 && ctx.magic_skill > 0.2`. ~60% of cats fall
below the affinity threshold and never see magic as a scoring option.

Contradicts `docs/systems/project-vision.md`'s framing of magic as an
ecological phenomenon — a kitten wandering into a FairyRing should feel
the pull whether or not it has "magic training." The misfire system
(`check_misfire`, `src/systems/magic.rs:919–940`) is the intended risk
gate for unskilled attempts; the scoring-level gate makes it unreachable.

Also touches `src/systems/disposition.rs:1675–1676, 1717–1718, 1748`
(redundant downstream gates that become dead once the scoring gate eases).
